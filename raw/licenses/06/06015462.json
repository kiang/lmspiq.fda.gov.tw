        "(A.) RECONSTITUTING SOLUTION (Liquid) :  \\nThis reagent is used for reconstitution of lyophilized Sensitized Cells and Un sensitized Cells,and consists of a phosphate buffered saline solution containing Normal rabbit serum and Sodium Azide (0.1﹪).\\n(B.) SERUM DILUENT (Liquid): \\nThis reagent is used for dilution of test serum and reconstitution of Serodia-HAAbsorbent and consists of a phosphate buffered saline solution containing Normal rabbit testicular extract,cell components of sonicated Reiter T. Phagedenis, normal rabbit serum and Sodium Azide (0.1﹪).\\n(C.) SENSITIZED CELLS (Lyophilized)\\nFixed chicken erythrocytes sensitized with components of pathogenic\\nTreponema Pallidum(Nichols Strain). Each vial must be rehydrated withthe prescribed quantity of Reconstituting Solution( to obtain 0.375% suspension) before utilization.\\n(D.) UNSENSITIZED CELLS (Lyophilized)\\nFixed chicken erythrocytes. The reagent of each vial must be rehydrated with the prescribed quantity of Reconstituting Solution ( to obtain 0.37",
        "(E.) POSITIVE CONTROL (Liquid) : \\nThis control is prepared from rabbit serum containing T. Pallidum and Sodium Azide (0.1﹪). The control should show a titer of 1:320 (Final Dilution).\\n(F.) SERODIA-HA ABSOBENT (Lyophilized)\\nUse for absorption of test sera which showed agglutination with unsensitized Cells   The reagent must be rehydrated with the prescribed quantity of SERUM DILUENT."
