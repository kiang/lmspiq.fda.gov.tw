        "ANTI-CORTISOL COATED TUBES：4 x 25 tubes\\nCortisol-3-O-Carboxymethyloxime-BSA was used as the antigen to generate the antiserum in rabbits. This antiserum is covalently bound to the inner surface of a polypropylene tube and is titered to provide 40 to 60% total binding in the absence of non radioactive Cortisol.\\nCORTISOL STANDARDS (6)：0.5 mL each\\nSix standards are provided at the following concentrations：0, 1.0, 3.0, 10, 30, and 100 ng\/dL. These standards have been prepared in a human serum matrix and contain sodium azide and gentamicin sulfate.\\nCORTISOL-125 I：2 x 52 mL\\nThis radioactive material contains less than 3 microcuries per vial on the date of calibration. 1.0 mL of this material will provide approximately 45,000 cpm on calibration day, using a counter with 75% efficiency."
