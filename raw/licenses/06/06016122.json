        "N Antisera are liquid animals sera and are produced by immunization of rabbits with highly purified human fibrinogen, antithrombin III, plasminogen, or C1 Inhibitor, Labile components are removed from the antisera by a special procedure. Microbial contamination is essentially excluded by filtration and addition of sodium azide as a preservative (<1g\/L). After solid phase immunoadsorption, the purified, specific antisera are specially tested and adjusted for optimal suitability for use on the BN* Systems. The antibody titers (T) are determined by radial immunodiffusion and are printed on the vial labels. The titers are indicate the quantity of antigen in mg which will be precipated in an agarose gel by 1 mL of the corresponding antiserum."
